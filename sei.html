Sei Whales

<h4>
The Sei Whale is the one of the fastest whales in the world. It can reach speeds of up to 50km/h. The whales eat copepods, krill, and other zooplankton.  The whale's name comes from the Norwegian word for pollock, a fish that appears off the coast of Norway at the same time of the year as the sei whale.
